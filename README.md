## mbtiles-cpp
MBTiles reader and vector map pbf v2.0/2.1 reader/writer. C++ library for encoding and decoding of mbtiles and vector data into function callbacks. It can be integrated by compiling it inline with your code by adding appropriate files to your project.

The MBTiles spec is at https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec

Vector tile spec is at https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec

UTFGrid spec is at https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec

MBTiles available at https://openmaptiles.org/ and https://www.mapbox.com/

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/smthnspcl/mbtiles-cpp

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

### Update pbf files
To update the protobuf files, get vector_tile.proto from https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec, remove the line "option optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME;", then

    mkdir vector_tile21
    protoc vector_tile.proto --cpp_out vector_tile21

protobuf lite is avoided because it doesn't contain SerializeToOstream functionality.
